/// Player Controller - Input handling and player entity management
/// 
/// This controller manages the player's ship in the classic shmup style of
/// Cho Ren Sha 68K, 1942, and TouHou Project. It handles:
///   - Arrow key movement with 8-directional control
///   - Space bar shooting with rate limiting
///   - Collision detection with enemy bullets and enemies
///   - Integration with GameState for lives management
/// 
/// Controls (from shmupbible):
///   - Arrow Keys: 8-directional movement (up, down, left, right, diagonals)
///   - Space (ui_accept): Shoot bullets upward
///   - X Key: Bomb (future feature, mentioned in shmupbible architecture)
/// 
/// Collision System:
///   - CollisionLayer = 1 (PLAYER layer)
///   - CollisionMask = 4 (detects ENEMY_BULLET layer)
///   - Player hurtbox detects both enemy bullets and enemy body collisions
/// 
/// Signal Flow on Hit:
///   PlayerController.PlayerHit -> [listeners]
///   PlayerController -> GameState.LoseLife() -> GameState.LivesChanged
///   -> Main.OnLivesChanged() -> Update HUD
/// 
/// The player starts at screen bottom-center (spawned by Main) and is
/// clamped to screen boundaries to prevent moving off-screen. This follows
/// the classic shmup convention where the player is always visible.
