/// Combat System - Centralized combat logic coordinator
/// 
/// This system is part of the Event-Driven Architecture described in the shmupbible,
/// serving as a centralized handler for combat-related events and logic. While
/// currently lightweight, it's designed to grow into a comprehensive combat manager.
/// 
/// Architecture Position: Game Systems Layer
///   - Sits between entities (Player, Enemy) and state management (GameState)
///   - Coordinates combat events: hits, kills, destruction
///   - Future: Damage calculation, combo systems, streak tracking
/// 
/// Current Responsibilities:
///   - Handle enemy death and scoring
///   - Handle boss defeat and stage progression
///   - Log combat events for debugging
/// 
/// Future Enhancements (from shmupbible EventBus design):
///   - Combo System: Track consecutive hits for multipliers
///   - Rank System: Adjust difficulty based on player performance
///   - Streak System: Bonus points for kill streaks
///   - Damage Calculation: Complex damage types (piercing, explosive, etc.)
///   - Visual Effects: Coordinate explosions, screen shake, particles
///   - Audio Events: Trigger combat sounds through Audio Manager
/// 
/// The centralized approach prevents combat logic from being scattered across
/// entity classes, making the system easier to balance and extend. This follows
/// the Single Responsibility Principle where entities handle their own state,
/// but shared combat logic lives in this system.
